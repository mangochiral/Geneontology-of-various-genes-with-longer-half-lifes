#### NAME:  Chandrima Modak
#### Language: Python
#### Date of Project completion: 28 Feb 2024

## Description
This script calculates the t-half life of between various genes and across 3 samples sets

## Execution
To run this file to you need  'DecayTimecourse.txt' file
Use python version >= 3.10.10
Requirements 
1. ```numpy >= 1.26.3```
2. ```pandas >= 2.1.0```
3. ```sklearn >= 1.4.0rc1```
5. ```math```
6. ```python3 Assignment_2.py```

## Output
2 files will be made

## Gene Ontology
For Gene Ontology:
1. The GOterm for Top 10 percentile by gProfiler can be found [here](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gplink/l/F-mbxL1RR6)
2. The GOterm for Bottom 10 percentile by gProfiler can be found [here](https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gplink/l/rR8p68DDQ9)
3. For Gene Ontology:
1. The GOterm for Top 10 percentile by GOterm finder {prefix} as 'goterm_top' *.svg
2. The GOterm for Bottom 10 percentile by GOterm finder {prefix} as 'goterm_bottom' *.svg
